# Whitbread Product Developer Test

## Summary
  There are some code that is in the app only as it's only for demo purposes, for example authentication token generated from foursquare is in plain text in RestAPI class and a lot of objects (models) have been created that are not being used as they've been automatically generated by jsonschema2pojo (http://www.jsonschema2pojo.org/)

  Also there was not a lot of attention on the UI as I don't think this is the main objective of this test, tried to keep it as simple and functional as possible.
